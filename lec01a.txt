When you need to show up:
  - TuTh, in this room from 12 to 3
  - A half-hour codewalk, every Wednesday (except tomorrow, 9/25)

Course staff:

  Instructors:
    - Jesse Tov, jesse@cs
    - Robby Findler, robby@cs

Homeworks:
  - Four steps: pull request, revision, codewalk, rerevision
    (details in schedule.md)
  - Pair programmed
  - Late homework won’t be accepted. Period.

Pair programming:
  - You will have a partner, assigned by the course staff.
  - Your partner will change each week.
  - You must do all work in this course with your partner, pair programming.
  - This means you’re in the same place, one person typing
    and one person providing an overview. Switch roles frequently.
  - You will present your code together, and each of you
    is responsible for all the code.
  - No divide and conquer or you will get bad grades

Grading (tentative):
  - homeworks: 70%
     - presentation grade (individual, given during codewalk)
     - code grade (shared with your partner, given after rerevision)
     - all of these grades are on a scale: ✓+, ✓, ✓-, zero
  - exam: 30%

Cheating
--------

  - You and your partner are jointly responsible for all code you turn in.
  - You cannot use code from other students or the web--you must
    write all of it yourself.
  - If you turn in stolen code, both you and your partner are
    responsible, even if your partner stole it and you didn’t know.
  - If you allow someone to steal your code, you are equally
    responsible.
  - Possible penalties range from a 0 on the stolen assignment to
    failing the class to being asked to leave the program.  We will
    involve the dean in making the decision about the punishment
