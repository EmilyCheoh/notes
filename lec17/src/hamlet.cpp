What is the difference? Many ordinary readers assume that there is a single text for the plays: what Shakespeare wrote. But Shakespeare's plays were not published the way modern novels or plays are published today: as a single, authoritative text. In some cases, the plays have come down to us in multiple published versions, represented by various Quartos (Qq) and by the great collection put together by his colleagues in 1623, called the First Folio (F). There are, for example, three very different versions of Hamlet, two of King Lear, Henry V, Romeo and Juliet, and others. Editors choose which version to use as their base text, and then amend that text with words, lines or speech prefixes from the other versions that, in their judgment, make for a better or more accurate text.");

When the Moby(r) Text was created, for example, it was deemed 'improper' and 'indecent' for Miranda to chastise Caliban for having attempted to rape her. (See The Tempest, 1.2: 'Abhorred slave,/Which any print of goodness wilt not take,/Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee...').
